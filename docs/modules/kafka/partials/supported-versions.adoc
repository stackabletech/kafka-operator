// The version ranges supported by Kafka-Operator
// This is a separate file, since it is used by both the direct Kafka documentation, and the overarching
// Stackable Platform documentation.

* 4.1.1 (experimental) - Requires KRaft, please read on the xref:kafka:usage-guide/kraft-controller.adoc[Kraft migration guide].
* 3.9.1 (LTS)

Support for clusters running in Kraft mode (which includes Apache Kafka 4.x.x) is experimental because it has not been thoroughly tested in production environments yet.

Also there are some known issues such as:

* Controller scaling is not reliable.
* Kerberos authentication is not tested yet.
* Service exposition is not definitive.
