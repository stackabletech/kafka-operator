:description: The managed Kafka instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.

The operator sets up all Kafka server instances with a JMX exporter agent.
The operator also sets up a dedicated metrics service for each role group.
The name of this service follows the schema `<stacklet name>-<role name>-<group name>-metrics`.
See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.
