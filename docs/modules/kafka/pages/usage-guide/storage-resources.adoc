= Storage and resource configuration

== Storage for data volumes

You can mount volumes where data is stored by specifying https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes[PersistentVolumeClaims] for each individual role group:

[source,yaml]
----
brokers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          storage:
            data:
              capacity: 2Gi
----

In the above example, all Kafka brokers in the default group will store data (the location of the property `log.dirs`) on a `2Gi` volume.

If nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, then by default each Pod will have a `1Gi` large local volume mount for the data location.

== Resource Requests

include::concepts:stackable_resource_requests.adoc[]

If no resource requests are configured explicitly, the Kafka operator uses the following defaults:

[source,yaml]
----
brokers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          memory:
            limit: '2Gi'
          cpu:
            min: '500m'
            max: '4'
          storage:
            log_dirs:
              capacity: 1Gi
----
