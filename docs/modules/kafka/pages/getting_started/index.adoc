:description: Start with Apache Kafka using Stackable Operator: Install, set up Kafka, and manage topics in a Kubernetes cluster.

This guide gets you started with Apache Kafka using the Stackable Operator.
It guides you through the installation of the Operator and its dependencies, setting up your first Kafka instance and create, write to and read from a topic.

== Prerequisites

You need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm
* https://github.com/edenhill/kcat#install[kcat] for testing

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point a minimum of the following resources is recommended for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM
