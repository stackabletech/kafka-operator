:description: Start with Apache Kafka using Stackable Operator: Install, set up Kafka, and manage topics in a Kubernetes cluster.

This guide will get you started with Apache Kafka using the Stackable Operator.
It will guide you through the installation of the Operator and its dependencies, setting up your first Kafka instance and create, write to and read from a topic.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm
* https://github.com/edenhill/kcat#install[kcat] for testing

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:
