Render the readme with `make render-readme`

Needed dependencies:

* jinja2
* https://github.com/mattrobenolt/jinja2-cli

Jinja tags are fancy - we need them to remove empty lines

* https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#whitespace-control

The tags could be simplified by using

* https://github.com/kolypto/j2cli#customization
* with `trim_blocks=True` `lstrip_blocks=True`

In general, empty lines being generated with little fine-grained control over them :(

* idea: use post-processing to make sure exactly one blank line is at the end of the final document
