## Installation

You can install the operator using [stackablectl or helm](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/{{operator_name}}/getting_started/installation).

Read on to get started with it, or see it in action in one of our [demos](https://stackable.tech/en/demos/).

## Getting Started

You can follow this [tutorial](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/{{operator_name}}/getting_started/first_steps) to create a Kafka cluster with three replicas.

## What Does This Do?

This operator is managing Kafka in Kubernetes. An operator observes custom resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and manages the application it's responsible for according to the desired state specified in those custom resources.

Here's an example how a custom resource to bring up a 3-replica Kafka cluster can look like:

```
---
apiVersion: kafka.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-kafka
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 3.4.0
  clusterConfig:
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-kafka-znode
    tls:
      serverSecretClass: null
  brokers:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 3
```
