= Stackable Operator for Apache Kafka

This is a Kubernetes Operator to manage Apache Kafka clusters.

It is written by https://www.stackable.de[Stackable] in Rust, and it is supposed to be used with the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent[Stackable Agent] instead of the Kubernetes kubelet.

The docs can be found in the `docs` subdirectory, and they are published together with docs for all other Stackable products at https://docs.stackable.tech.

This operator can work with the https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator[Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper] for ZooKeeper support and https://github.com/stackabletech/opa-operator[Stackable Operator for OPA] for OpenPolicyAgent support.
